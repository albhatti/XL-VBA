# XL VBA
I had to find a way to improve workplace efficiency for myself and my collegaues.

I started coding on and off using XL VBA since around 2-3 years using online resources and the little time I get after my work hours and my whole weekends. 
The code shared is version 4 of the code/file i created/compiled. In the early days  my code was not dynamic slowly slowly I made some big and small tweaks and made the code dynamic little by little. After around 3 main revisions the current version (V4) is the most dynamic VBA code I have written so far and there is still room for more improvement in it. 
All this with the little time after works and the weekends studying myself using resources online since 2-3 years.

How this code runs is:
1) A form is run.
2) Main module 1 is excecuted.
3) Main module 2 is executed as per the report type selected in the form.
4) Report template A is executed to create the report sheet. Subsequent reports are made based on this template by creating individual reports.
